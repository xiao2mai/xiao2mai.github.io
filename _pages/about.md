### My Education History

Hello, everyone! I am Xinyi, a master student of statistics of UC Davis. 
I got my bachelor degree at Beijing Normal University and my major is management science, 
which is a combination of operation research, economy, physics and computer science. 
What is more, my minor is psychology (BNU is No.1 at psychology field in China!) 
and this gives you an opportunity to know more about you and people around you. 
I highly recommend two very interesting courses: Social Psychology and Development Psychology. 
Thus, you can say I am a person with interdisciplinary background 
and I could find a common topic with people of different majors. 

### My Data Science Skill

I have taken a bunch of courses about statistics theory and methods at UC Davis, such as regression, 
mixed model, ANOVA, categorical data analysis, time series analysis, 
statistical computing, machine learning and so on.  
For the program language and software, I am familiar with:

- R
- Python
- SAS
- MATLAB
- SPSS
- SQL

Data scientist is my dream job because you can find a lot of interesting things 
and help others through data and model. 

### My Interests
Now, I am a data analyst at [Center for Educational Effectiveness](http://cee.ucdavis.edu/) of our school. 
Our mission is to help the students get a better learning experience and maximize the 
instructional effectiveness. My biggest interest is social science data analysis. 
I am also interested in marketing and biostatistics. 
In my free time, I love singing, Zumba and Guzheng, a traditional Chinese instrument. 
Singing is a really good way to release myself.
