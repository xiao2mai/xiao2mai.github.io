## Internship at CEE: Shiny Dashboards of DDD and KYS

Now, I am a student data analyst and programmer at [Center for Educational Effectiveness](http://cee.ucdavis.edu/) of our school.
The DDD(Department Diagnostic Dashboards) and KYS(Know Your Students) are two tools I and several other students built during 2016 summer.
The DDD could help provosts, deans and advisors know more about their departments students, instructors and courses. The main goal of KYS is to give a nice 
access to instructors for the backgrounds of students in their classes. They are built through R Shiny and are [web-based dashbaords](https://dashboards.ucdavis.edu/) now, but you may not have 
authorization to dig into them. Thus, we get some nice screenshots and if you want to know more, [please click here](https://github.com/xinyihou/shiny-dashboards-at-CEE).
