### Education
   I'm a master student in [department of statistics](https://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/) and [department of chemistry](http://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/)  UC Davis currently. I finished my undergraduate in [Xiamen University](http://www.xmu.edu.cn/en/), Fujian Province, China. 
### Why Data Science?
Curiosity is always my biggest motivation to explore the world. From the abstract logic of numbers, to the composition and transformation of substances, from the physical laws of objects, to the profound human behavior, in my view, all these are stories about the nature. I feel quite thrilled while discovering the tip of iceberg of how the world operates. In this era of massively abundant data, data scientist will hold the key to the mystery of what's going on in the world.
